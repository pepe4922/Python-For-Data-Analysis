# A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. However, it is not possible to add, remove, or modify values in a tuple. 
# A tuple is created by enclosing values within parentheses ( and ), separated by commas.

# check no. of elements
len(fruits)

# get an element (positive index)
fruits[0]

# check if it contains an element

# try to append an element

# You can also skip the parantheses `(` and `)` while creating a tuple. Python automatically converts comma-separated values into a tuple.

the_3_musketeers = 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis'

#You can also create a tuple with just one element by typing a comma after it. Just wrapping it with parentheses `(` and `)` won't make it a tuple.

# Tuple has 2 methods count and Index

# Count Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
# Index Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
